# Offborad-Control
In Ubuntu 16.04 system, based on ROS and gazebo, the external control flight of UAV is simulated, which makes it fly autonomously according to the program and get rid of human real-time control. It needs to build UAV Simulation Environment, mavros to realize the communication between UAV and computer, and the normal operation of external control program. This external control program is modified on the routine to improve the modularity. It only needs to simply set the number of cruise points, the coordinates of each shop and the error range of the target point.
